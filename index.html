    <h2>About Me<h2>
    <p>Several years ago, my little sister was failing her high school programming class, so I taught myself some Python in order to tutor her. I had no experience with coding but I quickly discovered I loved the problem-solving nature of it. My work experience was primarily in healthcare support roles, and though the work was rewarding, I decided it was time to pursue a career in programming.</p>
