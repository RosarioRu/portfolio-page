      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Several years ago, my little sister was failing her high school programming class, so I taught myself some Python in order to tutor her. I had no experience with coding but I quickly discovered I loved the problem-solving nature of it. My work experience was primarily in healthcare support roles, and though the work was rewarding, I decided it was time to pursue a career in programming.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/RosarioRu/first-webpage">First Webpage</a>
        <p>This project was created to learn how to incorporate fundmental HTML elements and become familiar with Git. We practiced block, inline elements, and linking stylesheets. It is made up of several different pages.</p>
        <p>Languages used: HTML and CSS</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/RosarioRu/pet-website2">Meow-Meow</a>
        <p>A simple website created to practice indentation and spacing.</p>
        <p>Languages used: HTML</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/RosarioRu/Cup-Cake-Shop/blob/main/index.html">Cupcake Shop</a>
        <p>In this project we created a fake cup-cake shop to learn about styling with classes.</p>
        <p>Languages used: HTML and CSS</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/RosarioRu/portland-seattle">Portland VS Seattle</a>
        <p>We created a webpage comparing and contrasting these two cities in order to practice styling. In particular, we were working on stying with divs and spans.</p>
        <p>Languages used: HTML and CSS</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/RosarioRu/animal-shelter-website.html">Animal Shelter</a>
        <p>This project's obective was to further practice styling in CSS, with a special focus on the concept of cascading styles. It allowed us to see how style rules can be inherited but also overriden in CSS. It also allowed additional practice with the box model.</p>
